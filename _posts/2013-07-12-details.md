<b>Deleterious Probabilities</b>

SIFT

<b>Allele Frequency Data</b>

1000G, combined allele frequency, combined allele count
EVS, combined allele frequency, combined allele count

<b>Genes</b>

approved HGNC gene symbols, names, and synonyms
transcripts and exons from RefSeq that can be mapped to HGNC genes

<b>Gene Lists</b>

the single gene list will be in there as well

<b>Disease and Phenotype</b>

diseases loaded from HGMD linked at the gene level and variant level
early stages of phenotype data loaded from NCBO linked to gene

<b>Variant Effects</b>

SNPEff variant effects and impact

<b>PubMed IDs</b>

derived from HGMD and linked to genes and variants

<b>Project-level hierarchy</b>

all samples are tracked via the following hierarchy (this enables a permissions system): PROJECT → COHORT → SAMPLE → RESULTS

<b>Samples</b>

Standard VCF fields - genotype, quality, depth of coverage, etc.

<b>Analysis Workflow</b>

the first step is to select a sample that is of interest
a step-by-step dialog taking the user through most of the above listed annotations with proper defaults
