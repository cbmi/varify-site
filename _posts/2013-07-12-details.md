## Annotations and Features

Below is a list of the current filters that can be applied to separate out meaningful variants from your data
to be viewed in the report.


<b>Deleterious Probabilities</b>

SIFT
PolyPhen2

<b>Allele Frequency Data</b>

1000G, combined allele frequency, combined allele count
EVS, combined allele frequency, combined allele count

<b>Genes</b>

Approved HGNC gene symbols, names, and synonyms<br>
Transcripts and exons from RefSeq that can be mapped to HGNC genes<br>
Single gene list

<b>Disease and Phenotype</b>

Diseases loaded from HGMD linked at the gene level and variant level<br>
Early stages of phenotype data loaded from NCBO linked to gene

<b>Variant Effects</b>

SNPEff variant effects and impact

<b>PubMed IDs</b>

Derived from HGMD and linked to genes and variants

<b>Samples</b>

Standard VCF fields - genotype, quality, depth of coverage, etc.

<b>HGMD SNV-Phenotype Associations</b>

The first of ten mutation-disease association data tables provided by HGMD has been loaded. This includes phenotypes/disease associated with point mutations (SNVs). This introduces:

70,000+ variant-disease associations<br>
43,000+ gene-disease associations<br>
5100+ new phenotypes (in addition to HPO's 5200)

<b>Presence in HGMD</b>

Includes a filter under the Phenotypes tab that enables filtering variants based on their presence in HGMD. In addition, if there are known HGMD 
IDs associated with a variant, they are now visible in the Summary section of the variant result view.

<b>Chromosome and Position</b>

Samples can be filtered by chromosome and/or position in the analysis view.
