### Demo

Get started and see what Varify can do for your sequencing data here:

LINK to demo

To begin, select a project, batch, and sample.  Then begin filtering the data. Filters available
include depth of coverage, genomic position, common variants, cohort variants, deleterious predictions,
predicted variant effects, phenotypes, genes, and gene details. After filtering, select view variants.
You can then chose to sort the filtered variants based on a variety of factors.  To view details on each
variant, click on the name, which will open up the [HGNC](http://www.genenames.org/) page for that variant in a new tab, as well as
bring up the variant details and knowledge capture tabs in the Varify page.  The variant details tab
provides information about the variant, such as associated phenotypes and prediction scores.  The 
knowledge capture tab allows the user to enter his or her own information about the variant, such as
pathogenicity or parental results. To export your data to an excel file, select the Export option in the
top toolbar.
