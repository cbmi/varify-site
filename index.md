    <h3>What is Verify?</h3>
        <p>Varify is an integrated data warehouse and analysis suite that enables a researcher to annotate variants one
			sample at a time. Next generation sequencing technologies are allowing researchers to generate millions of genomic
			variants routinely, and this provides opportunities to uncover information involving
			allele frequencies and variant differences between various samples, patients, and cohorts. </p>

    <h3>Who developed Verify?</h3>
        <p>Varify was developed by the Center for Biomedical Informatics at the Children's Hospital 
        	of Philadelphia in colloboration with the NHGRI Clinical Sequencing Exploratory
			Research program, and CHOP's clinical laboratories.</p>

      <h3>How was Verify built?</h3>
          <p>It was built using
		<a href="http://harvest.research.chop.edu/">Harvest</a>, an open-source, web-based biomedical application
			development framework. Varify's data warehouse was deployed on the open-source PostgreSQL relational
			database.

         <h3>What does Verify do?</h3>
         <p>Unique variants are combined from all samples into one table.  The report for each sample
			includes a variety of annotations, and the user has the ability to sort his or her results according
			to various filters.
